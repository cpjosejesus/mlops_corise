    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the project this week, we will conduct detailed model evaluation, data quality testing and behavioral testing for the news classification model from the week 1 project.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will look at evaluation metrics beyond overall accuracy and f1 score (per-class metrics, confusion matrix, per-class false positive and false negative errors)\n",
    "2. We will implement bootstrap sampling to measure confidence intervals of model performance metrics\n",
    "3. We will implement behavioral tests using a popular open source library called checklist\n",
    "4. [advanced] Advanced data quality and behavioral tests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "1. Test set per-class accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 score\n",
    "2. Test set confusion matrix, and per-class false positive, false negative errors\n",
    "3. 95% confidence intervals for test set metrics as estimated via bootstrap sampling\n",
    "4. Behavioral tests for the trained news classification model, using checklist.\n",
    "5. [Optional] Advanced data quality and behavioral tests\n",

    "\n",
    "In Week 2 instruction, we learned about the importance of evaluating data quality across the ML lifecycle:\n",
    "* When building your first ML model, you often have no data and have to invest in annotation resources to get labels\n",
    "* Dataset labels can be noisy as they are collected from a variety of different sources.\n",
    "* Real world evolves (drift) and so should the datasets you’re using to train models (to make sure they evolve along with it).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Great Expectations](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/) is a popular Python library for validating data in Machine Learning pipelines. It contains several built-in Expectation types to configure tests, as well as integrations with common data structures used to store datasets (e.g. Pandas dataframes, CSV files, MySQL databases etc). We will be using this library to define and run some data quality tests for our dataset. The goal and scope of the exercise here is to get you acquainted with the library and practice of testing for data quality.\n",

In this exercise, we will evaluate the News category classification from Week 1 in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Aggregate performance metrics**: Using standard metrics to evaluate ML model performance such as accuracy, mean squared error, BLEU scores etc (depending on the ML task) is a necessary first step, but far from sufficient. It serves to filter out models that are clearly suboptimal and reduces risk of launching bad models\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Slice-level performance metrics**: It is important to track model performance not just in aggregate but for important cohorts/slices of your traffic. For example, it is important to track the performance of your hate speech detection model not just in aggregate but for traffic from each country, language etc to understand the gaps in performance.\n",

    "## Step 4 (Part 3): Minimum Functionality behavioral Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit tests and integration tests play an important role in testing software for bugs, inefficiencies and potential vulnerabilities. Can we employ a similar approach to testing ML models? This exercise introduces the concept of “behavioral testing”  for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum Functionality Tests are a class of behavioral tests, and equivalents of “unit tests in software engineering” - a collection of simple examples (and labels) to check a behavior. A recommended practice is to write minimum functionality tests for highly visible/high cost potential failure modes, and for failure modes that you uncover during error analysis to guard against such failures in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will use a popular open source library called [Checklist](https://github.com/marcotcr/checklist) to configure and run behavioral tests for our model. The goal and scope of the exercise here is to get you acquainted with the library and practice of testing for minimum functionality.\n",
